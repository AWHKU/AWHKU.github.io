## Our research mission

Many disease pathogeneses are governed by multifactorial interactions involving complex sets of genes and pathways instead of a single genetic perturbation.We are interested in developing and applying high-throughput combinatorial genetic technologies to pinpoint novel mechanisms underlying complex diseases including cancers and neurodegenerative disorders to devise new combination therapies. We are also interested in developing new genome engineering tools and exploring their therapeutic potentials.

Despite the enormous potential with combination therapy, there are only limited combination regimens that have been isolated and characterized. 
To circumvent the need to individually test every possible combinations that is prohibitively expensive and impracticable, our platform enable the rapid discovery of combination-based treatment strategies for various complex diseases, including devising combination drug therapies for cancers and new cell differentiation formulas involving specific combinatorial effectors important for regenerative medicine applications.
