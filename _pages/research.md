## Our research mission

Many disease pathogeneses are governed by multifactorial interactions involving complex sets of genes and pathways instead of a single genetic perturbation.We are interested in developing and applying high-throughput combinatorial genetic technologies to pinpoint novel mechanisms underlying complex diseases including cancers and neurodegenerative disorders to devise new combination therapies. We are also interested in developing high-throughput protein engineering methods to create new toolkits for genome engineering and beyond.
