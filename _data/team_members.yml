  education1: Our group has developed CombiSEAL which allows high-throughput assembly of barcoded protein variants and rapid profiling of the functional impact brought by combinatorial mutations. I am interested in applying the platform for engineering therapeutically useful proteins and advancing our understanding of the underexplored sequence-function relationship of a protein.
